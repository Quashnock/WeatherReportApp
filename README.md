# WeatherReportApp

Link: https://quashnock.github.io/WeatherReportApp/

This project was meant to give me more practice using react and
get me started with using APIs. This site uses the OpenWeather API
(https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the current weather and 
forecast data from searching for a city. Can also click temperature readings
to change from imperial to metric units.

Note:
  Not currently responsive, works best on desktop aspect ratio
